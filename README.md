### ensemble of drug associated TMPRSS2 structures
This repository contains supplementary material for 
Hempel et al, *Molecular mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 cell entry
inhibition via TMPRSS2 by Camostat and Nafamostat*, preprint, 2020,
[https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.21.214098](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.21.214098v1).


We provide representative structures of drug-associated states to
TMPRSS2 as drawn from extensive MD simulations and Markov modeling. 
The set of drugs currently includes nafamostat, camostat, and its 
metabolic product GBPA. Please note that nafamostat has
two binding modes ("forward" and "backward").

We further present structures of otamixaban in complex with TMPRSS2
(state with the largest population).
